My name is Jaewoo Kim, a phd student in Mechanical Engineering department of UT Austin. I am interested in programming and physics modelling.
My current research topic is Femto-second laser sintering modelling using multi-scale approach, such as heat transfer model or radiation transfer 
modeling using Finite element method, Finite difference method, Molecular dynmic(or DEM). I am also an self-motivated learner of
programming such as parallel computing(my favorite!).

I am currently studying data structures, operating system for general use for my future projects!
